    <!--Ordered list for the directions to make the salsa-->
    <ol style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 10ch; margin-right: 10ch">
        <li>Place tomatoes into a colander set over a large bowl and allow to drain. Save drained juice to add back to salsa if it
        is too thick or save to add to soups or other dishes.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onion to a medium bowl and cover with cold water. Set aside for 10 minutes, drain, and then rinse.</li>
        <li>Add garlic to a blender or bowl of a food processor and pulse until chopped small. Scrape the sides, and then add the
        drained tomatoes, drained and rinsed onions, peppers, cilantro, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and the juice of half a lime.
        Pulse until your desired texture. Taste, and then season with additional salt or lime juice. (We typically add 3/4
        teaspoon of salt).</li>
        <li>This salsa improves with time so if you have the option, set it aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or more before
        serving. Store in the refrigerator up to a week.</li>
